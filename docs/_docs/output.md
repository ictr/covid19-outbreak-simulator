## Events tracked during the simulation

This simulator simulations individuals in a population using an event-based model. Briefly
speaking,

1. The simulator creates an initial population with a set of initial `events` (see later section for details)

2. The events will happen at a pre-specified time and will trigger further events. For example,

  an `INFECTION` event will cause someone to be infected with the virus. The individual will be marked as `infected` and according to individualized parameters of the infectivity of the infected individual, the `INFECTION` event may trigger a series of events such as `INFECTION` to other
  individuals, `SHOW_SYMPTIOM` if he or she is symptomatic and will show symptom after an incubation
  period, `REMOVAL` or `QUARANTINE` after symptoms are detected.

3. The simulator processes and logs the events and stops after pre-specified exit condition.

Currently the following events are tracked

| Name                | Event                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ABORT` | If the first carrier show sympton during quarantine.                                    |
| `END` | Simulation ends.                                                                        |
| `ERROR` | An error was raised.                                                      |
| `INFECION_FAILED` | No one left to infect                                                                   |
| `INFECTION_AVOIDED` | An infection happended during quarantine. The individual might not have showed sympton. |
| `INFECTION_IGNORED` | Infect an infected individual, which does not change anything.                          |
| `INFECTION` | Infect an non-quarantined individual, who might already been infected.                  |
| `QUARANTINE` | Quarantine someone till specified time.                                               |
| `RECOVER` | Recovered, no longer infectious                                                         |
| `REINTEGRATION` | Reintroduce the quarantined individual to group.                                        |
| `REMOVAL` | Remove from population.                                                                 |
| `SHOW_SYMPTOM` | Show symptom.                                                                           |
| `VACCINATION` | Vaccination                                                                      |
| `REPLACEMENT` | A special event that replace the existing individual with a new uninfected one. |
| `START` | Start up simulation.                                                                    |
| `STAT` | Report population stats at specified intervals.                                         |


The log file contains all events that happens during the simulations. For example, for command

```
outbreak_simulator --repeat 100 --popsize 64 --logfile result_remove_symptomatic.txt
```

You will get an output file `result_remove_symptomatic.txt` with the following columns:

| column   | content                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id` | id of the simulation.                                                                                                  |
| `time` | time of the event in days, accurate to hour.                                                                           |
| `event` | type of event                                                                                                          |
| `target` | subject of the event, for example the ID of the individual that has been quarantined.                                  |
| `params` | Additional parameters, mostly for the `INFECTION` event where simulated $R_0$ and incubation period will be displayed. |

and would look like the following:

```
id      time    event   target  params
2       0.00    START   .       id=2,time=06/23/2020-17:51:39,args=--infector 0
2       0.00    INFECTION       0       r0=2.10,r=0,r_presym=0,r_sym=0,incu=4.99
2       4.99    SHOW_SYMPTOM    0       .
2       4.99    REMOVAL 0       popsize=63
2       11.33   RECOVER 0       recovered=0,infected=0,popsize=63,True=True
2       11.33   END     63      popsize=63,prop_asym=0.123,time=06/23/2020-17:51:39
3       0.00    START   .       id=3,time=06/23/2020-17:51:39,args=--infector 0
3       0.00    INFECTION       0       r0=1.49,r=0,r_presym=0,r_sym=0,incu=5.47
3       5.47    SHOW_SYMPTOM    0       .
3       5.47    REMOVAL 0       popsize=63
3       11.64   RECOVER 0       recovered=0,infected=0,popsize=63,True=True
3       11.64   END     63      popsize=63,prop_asym=0.220,time=06/23/2020-17:51:39
7       0.00    START   .       id=7,time=06/23/2020-17:51:39,args=--infector 0
7       0.00    INFECTION       0       r0=0.43,r=0,r_asym=0
```

which I assume would be pretty self-explanatory. Note that **the simulation IDs
are not ordered because the they are run in parallel but you can expect all events
belong to the same simulation are recorded together.**.

## Summary report from multiple replicates

At the end of each command, a report will be given to summarize key statistics from
multiple replicated simulations. The output contains the following keys and their values

NOTE: All `avg_` fields have average over existing replicates, and all replicates. For
example, if at time 100, 8 of the replicate simulations have completed and the rest 2
have population size 5, and 10, the average population size will be reported as
`7.5` ( `5+10/2` ) and `0.15` ( `5+10/10` ).
