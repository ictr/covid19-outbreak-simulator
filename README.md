# COVID19 Outbreak Simulator

COVID-19 Outbreak Simulator is a population-based simulator that simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a dynamic and heterogeneous population, subject to preventative measures and post-outbreak action plans such as quarantine, testing, and removal of symptomatic cases. Outputs from the simulator can be used to obtain quantitative measures of the effectiveness of these actions.

Please refer to our [homepage](https://ictr.github.io/covid19-outbreak-simulator/) for details. Please cite

if you have used the simulator for your work.
